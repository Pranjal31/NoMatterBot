# Bot

## Bot Implementation

### Bot Platform:
+ Set up Mattermost server on Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS VM.
+ Created a bot account for NoMatterBot on the Mattermost server. Added it to team's default channel
+ Implemented a Bot server component that listens to events/triggers on a particular port on the localhost. Used ngrok to make the server publically accessible (over the web). 

### Bot Integration
+ For all use cases, NoMatterBot initiates conversations with users. 
+ All the conversations are event-based. Bot server catches events (e.g. issue creation on GitHub) and posts relevant messages on a direct channel on Mattermost. 
+ While some messages require user action (assignee recommendation, closing stale issues), no user action is needed for certain messages (status change notification). The user actions are triggers that need to be listened for by Bot server.

Note: 
1) Responses to NoMatterBot's messages are interactive (button click, dropdown selection). Such responses initiate triggers. In fact, the response to NoMatterBot neither needs nor processes text messages.
2) Essentially, the Bot server is a Mattermost Integration (can receive triggers)

## Use Cases Refinement

### Use case: Closing Stale Issues
Preconditions: \
Bot must have GitHub API token and a Mattermost access token. GithHub users must also have an account on Mattermost

Main flow: \
Once every day, the bot will scan through all the open issues and ping assignees if they have any stale issues (issues which have had no activity in the last six months). The bot asks if an assignee wants to close all their stale issues. The assignee can choose to close all stale issues or ignore them for a day.

Sub-flows:\
[S1] Bot scans through all the open issues \
[S2] Bot filters out stale issues and groups them by assignee\
[S3] Bot pings the assignees to ask if all of their stale issues can be closed\
[S4] Assignees can choose to close all issues by 'Close All Issues' button. Bot closes the issues and acknowledges\
[S5] Otherwise assignees can hit 'Ignore' button to ignore the issues for a day. Bot acknowledges it

Note: In the design milestone, presenting a checkbox to user was proposed so that they could choose a subset of stale issues to close. However, this could not be implemented because of an existing [issue](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/cannot-open-dialog/7842/3) with Mattermost.

### Use Case: Change Issue Status

Preconditions: \
Bot must have GitHub API token. Pull Requests (PR) must include GitHub Issue number at the start of PR title Issue (separated by '-')
Example title: '4-Bot server fails to handle triggers'

Main Flow: \
User will create a PR (or close an approved PR). It would change the issueâ€™s status to "in review" (if closing PR, from "in review" to "test").

Sub-flows: \
[S1] Bot identifies the triggered event (PR creation / PR closure)\
[S2] Bot identifies the corresponding issue from the issue ID embedded in PR title\
[S3] If the identified event is PR creation, Bot changes the issue status to "in review"\
[S4] If the identified event is PR closure, Bot changes the issue status from "in review" to "test"

Alternative Flows: \
PR is not approved. Bot doesn't take any action.
			
### Use Case: Notify Change in Issue Status

Preconditions: \
Bot must have a Mattermost access token. GithHub users must also have an account on Mattermost

Main Flow: \
Any change in GitHub issue status would create an event. The Bot captures the event and notifies the assignee about the change on Mattermost 

Sub-flows: \
[S1] Bot identifies the issue status change event\
[S2] Bot identifies the assignee of the issue\
[S3] Bot notifies the assignee of the status change on Mattermost

### Use Case: Assignee Recommendation

Preconditions: \
Bot must have GitHub API token, Mattermost access token and the permissions to set assignees for GitHub Issues.

Main flow:\
A user creates an issue without selecting an assignee. Bot analyses developer workloads and recommends top three potential assignees to the issue creator on Mattermost. The user can select an assignee or ignore the message altogether. The bot sets an assignee, if one is chosen.

Sub-flows:\
[S1] User creates an issue with no assignee set.\
[S2] The bot compares the workload of different developers based on their number of open issues\
[S3] Based on previous analysis, the bot suggests top three potential assignees to issue creator on Mattermost\
[S3] Issue creator selects an assignee. The bot sets the chosen assignee for the issue and confirms it to issue creator\
[S4] Otherwise, issue creator can ignore the recommendation. The bot would acknowledge it.

Alternative flows:\
[A1] If the user creates an issue with an assignee, Bot won't take any action\
[A2] If more than three developers have the same workload, a lexograhic tie-breaking mechanism is used to decide the top three.

## Mocking infrastructure
Mocking infrastructure consists of different mock json files to abstract away different functionalities/services. The details are as follows:

+ mock_statChange.json: Used to abstract away issue status change events when testing status change notifications
+ mockIssues.json: Used to abstract getting all issues for a repository when integration testing assignee recommendations
+ mockNewIssue.json: Used to abstract away new issue creation event when testing assignee recommendations
+ mockStaleIssues.json: Used to abstract away finding stale issues. This is used both for implementation and testing of stale issues use case
+ mockUsers.json: Used to abstract away getting collaborators for a repository used for testing assignee recommendations

### Nock
nock module has been utilised to mock GitHub service. This set-up responds with a 200 Ok status-code for REST calls made to GitHub. After getting a status 200 Ok, Bot sends an appropriate message to user on Mattermost

## Selenium/Puppeteer testing of each use case

Puppeteer has been used to test our three primary usecases.

+ Use case - Status Change Notification: 

The test starts by mocking the status change event and launching Mattermost to post the corresponding message to the assignee. The test passes if the expected message has been posted on assignee's mattermost channel.

+ Use case - Assignee Recommendation: 

The test suite consists of three sub-tests.
1. First test starts by mocking the new issue created event. Bot then posts the corresponding assignee recommendations to the creator on Mattermost. If the posted message is the same as expected, the test passes. 
2. Second test starts by invoking "assign" button-click event (Happy Path) via Puppeteer and mocking the response from Mattermost. If Bot's reply to this Mattermost's message is same as defined in test-case, it passes. 
3. Third test starts by invoking "Ignore" button-click event (Alternative Path) via Puppeteer and mocking the response from Mattermost. If Bot's reply to this Mattermost's message is same as defined in test-case, it passes. 

+ Use case - Stale Issues: 

The test suite consists of three sub-tests.
1. First test starts by mocking system timer expiry event (24 hours). This triggers the Bot to post the list of Stale Issues on Mattermost. If the posted message is the same as expected, the test passes. 
2. Second test starts by invoking "Close All Issues" button-click event (Happy-path) via Puppeteer and mocking the response from Mattermost. If Bot's reply to this message from Mattermost is same as defined in test-case, it passes. 
3. Third test starts by invoking "Ignore" button-click event (Alternative Path) via Puppeteer and mocking the response from Mattermost. If Bot's reply to this message from Mattermost is same as defined in test-case, it passes.
