# PROCESS

## Process

We have two sprints for developing our bot:
+ Wed Oct 23-- Fri Nov 1
+ Sat Nov 2--Fri Nov 8th

We have divied our tasks into total 9 stories. Each of us were assigned following stories with associated stoey points:
+ Pranjal Sharma:\
	Story: 1, 6\
	Story points: 8
+ Sridhar Kulkarni:\
	Story: 2, 5\
	Story points: 6
+ Vaishakh Bhadrappanavar:\
	Story: 3, 4\
	Story points: 6
+ Anjali Malunjkar:\
	Story: 7, 8, 9\
	Story points: 7

For every iteration, we assigned tasks to ourselves. The scrumban board for the beginning of each iteratoin is as follows:
+ [Iteration 1](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)
+ [Iteration 2](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)

When a developer starts working on a story, they move their card to "In progress" column. The scrumban board status was as follows for each iteration:
+ [Iteration 1](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)
+ [Iteration 2](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)

Once a developer finsihes working and testing the code on local, they create a pull request and move the card to "In review". The scrumban board status was as follows for each iteration:
+ [Iteration 1](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)
+ [Iteration 2](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)

When the pull request has been approved by other devlopers, the card is moved to "Done" column. The scrumban board status was as follows for each iteration:
+ [Iteration 1](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)
+ [Iteration 2](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)


For every iteration, we had daily standup meetings and we logged the minutes of meeting in a google doc every day. They are as follows:

+ [Iteration 1](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)
+ [Iteration 2](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/tree/dev/scrumban/Iteration1)
