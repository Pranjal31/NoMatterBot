This document provides final report for our project - NoMatterBot.

## The Problem solved by the Bot
Issue Tracking Software like JIRA and Github Issues allow users to create issues for managing tasks and bugs in software engineering projects. However, most of the time managing issues itself becomes a taxing task. A considerable amount of a team's time is spent on the following issue management tasks: 

**Stale Issue Management:** Some issues are created and kept on hold because of lack of resources among other things. Over time, these issues become stale and continue to remain in the open issues list. Manually following up on these issues can prove to be burdensome.

**Assignee Recommendation:** For assigning a new issue to someone, one has to manually go through potential assignees' current load (e.g. number of issues currently being worked upon) or talk to them directly to get some idea about their current workload. To make good a good assignment, skillset of potential assignees must also be considered. Figuring out the best assignee could take up a some time.

**Changing Issue Status:** An assignee / manager / scrum master has to manually change an issueâ€™s status from one state to another. For example, if a Pull Request (PR) related to an issue has been approved, merged, and closed, the status must be changed to "in test".

**Status Change Notifications:** Most of the issue tracking systems either do not notify watchers about changes in issue status or send it over email which is not very convenient.

All the tasks mentioned above are repetitive and mundane. A team's valuable time can be freed up if the above tasks are offloaded to another entity. **Enter: NoMatterBot** - A ChatDevBot designed for efficient management of issues on GitHub by automating mundane tasks.

## Primary features and screenshots

The detailed explaination related to the design of the bot and usecases can be found [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/blob/master/DESIGN.md).
 
Furthermore, details related to acceptance testing for each usecase can be found [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/blob/master/DEPLOY.md).
 
The primary features of NoMatterBot are as follows:

### Stale Issue Management
 
The bot is configured with a cron job which runs every day and finds the Stale Issues (Issues which have had no activity on them in the last 6 months) and presents it to the assignees/creator on mattermost with the option to Close the individual Issues, Close All Issues and Ignore All issues.
  
Note: To simplify the testing process, the cron job is scheduled to run every minute and if there is no activity on an issue for more than 2 minutes, the Issue is considered as a stale issue.
  
The following screen captures depict Stale Issue Management
  - Stale Issue Message Posted on Mattermost, depicting all the stale Issues with Issue Name, Issue Number and the repository with the option to `Close`, `Close All`, `Ignore All`.

 ### Assignee Recommendation
 
Upon Issue creation the bot takes in to account 1) skills required for the issue (mentioned in issue body) and the skillset of assignment candidates and 2) workload of candidates and provides top recommendations to the issue creator
  
The screen captures below depicts the assignee recommendation message received on Mattermost upon issue creation
  - Assignee Recommendation message on Mattermost, the dropdown contains the list of recommendations.

 ###  Automatic Issue Status change

Issue status gets updated automatically based on some Pull Request(PR) events. When a new PR is created referencing an existing issue on GitHub, the status of that issue gets changed to "in review". This is done by addition/update of status label on the issue. Similarly, if a PR referencing an issue gets merged, the status of the corresponding issue gets changed to "in test".

- A new issue is created
![New Issue](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/blob/master/img/report-images/stat-change-new-issue.png)

- A new PR is created that references the issue
![New PR](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/blob/master/img/report-images/stat-change-pr-create.png)

- Issue status changes to "in review"
![In review](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/blob/master/img/report-images/stat-changed-ir.png)

- The PR is merged
![PR merged](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/blob/master/img/report-images/stat-change-pr-merge.png)

- Issue status changes to "in test"
![In test](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/blob/master/img/report-images/stat-changed-ir.png)


### Issue Status Change Notification

For each issue status change, a notification is sent to the assignee (or the issue creator, if there is no assignee) on Mattermost. 

- Issue status changes (status change notification messages can be triggered due to automatic status change usecase as well as due to manual change) 
    - The notifications generated due to Automatic Status Change usecase can be seen below:
        PR creation:
        ![notify-ir](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/blob/master/img/report-images/notify-ir.png)

        PR merge:
        ![notify-it](https://github.ncsu.edu/csc510-fall2019/CSC510-12/blob/master/img/report-images/notify-it.png)

    - The notifications generated due to manual Status Change usecase can be seen below:

## Our reflection on the development process and project
 - We followed many software design processes and testing methodologies during the course of the project which helped ensure efficient and streamlined flow of our work. 
 - Integration testing and mocking framework helped us visualize the overall working and flow of Bot software. 
 - We utilized this as the base to fill in the missing parts and make it work in real time.
 - We followed Scrum framework and Kanban workflow practice during the development phase of the project. 
 - Breaking down the whole project into small user stories helped us deliver small and deliver often. This allowed us to keep adding value to the bot software. It also helped us distribute workload equally among ourselves. 
 - Since Kanban stories focus on value addition to the user, we used these stories as metrics to gauge our use cases. This helped us improve upon our use cases and provide better user experience with NoMatterBot. 
 - Meeting with team-mates frequently for collaboration, reporting our work and future plan ensured that we made steady progress developing NoMatterBot.
 - Most of the things we learnt during the development of this project are suitable to be used in future projects as well. This project gave us very good exposure to many technical skills as well as software processes like Scrumban. Overall, it was an engaging project, with lots of new things to learn. The project also provided ample opportunities to implement and use our learnings as we designed, developed, tested and deployed NoMatterBot.

## Any limitations and future work
The following are  some of the limitations observed in NoMatterBot:
 - Addition of a new User to the bot's database and the Github repository. There is no user interface to add new developers (manual changes have to be made in Database)
 - New skills for a user have to be manually added to the database
 - Removal of a user along with skillset (moving to a different project or leaving the organization) is manual
 - We have assumed in our use cases that there is always a single assignee per issue. The cases of multiples assignees per issue in case of stale issues management and assigning a single issue to multiple assignees havent been covered.
 
The above limitations can be addressed in future as described below:
- Create API to add new Users to the database (using a message sent to NoMatterBot)
- Create API to update the skills of the User (using a message sent to NoMatterBot)
- Create API to remove the User and skillset once the user leaves the project/organization (using a message sent to NoMatterBot)
- Update the APIs and implement code to handle multiple assignees per issue.
