## The Problem solved by the Bot

## Primary features and screenshots

## Our reflection on the development process and project
 - We followed many software design processes and testing methodologies during the course of the project which helped ensure efficient and stream-lined flow of our work. 
 - The Integration testing and mocking frame-work we created, helped us to visualize the overall working and flow of the Botâ€™s software. 
 - We utilized this as the base to fill-in the missing parts of our software and make it work in real time.
 - We followed Scrum framework and Kanban workflow practice during the development phase of the project. 
 - Breaking down the whole project into smaller chunks in the form of short user stories made our work plan oriented and manageable. It also helped us distribute work-load equally among ourselves. 
 - Since Kanban stories focus on value addition to the user, we used these stories as metrics to gauge our use cases. This helped us improve upon our use-cases and provide for better user experience with NoMatterBot. 
 - Meeting with team-mates every day, reporting our work and future plan ensure that we made steady progress developing NoMatterBot software.
 - Most of the things we learnt during the development of this project are suitable to be used in our future projects as well. This project gave us a very good exposure to many technical as well as Software development cycle practices like Agile etc.   Overall, it was an engaging project, with lots of new things to learn and many opportunities to implement and use them as we designed, built, tested and deployed NoMatterBot.
